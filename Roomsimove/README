SIMULATION OF MOVING SOURCES

This software is designed to simulate the recording of a moving source by one or more microphones in a reverberant room. To compute the signal x recorded at the microphones defined in room_sensor_config.txt when a source emits the signal s sampled at fs Hz while moving along the piecewise linear path defined in source_config.txt, type

[time,HH]=roomsimmove('room_sensor_config.txt','source_config.txt',fs);
x=roomsimove_apply(time,HH,s,fs);

Examples of room/microphone configurations and source paths are given in room_sensor_config.txt and source_config.txt respectively.

Moving room impulse responses are obtained by linear interpolation of static room impulse reponses computed at discrete points over the path. A theoretical justification of this approach along with some error bounds is given in roomsimove.m.


SIMULATION OF STATIC SOURCES

The static room impulse reponses are computed by roomsimove_single.m, which is a stripped-down version of the Roomsim toolbox version 3.3 by Douglas R. Campbell previously available at http://media.paisley.ac.uk/~campbell/Roomsim/

Differences with Roomsim version 3.3:
- three or more sensors allowed
- faster implementation
- distance and air attenuation applied to all image sources whatever their distance and modeled by a variable filter length (usually shorter)
- no low-pass filter included in the fractional delay filters
- no check of sensor/source positions (must be in the room and distant from at least 5 cm)
- no check of simulation time or memory overflow

Default parameters:
humidity=40
temperature=20 (corresponding to c=343m/s)
order=-1 (default reflection order)
H_length=-1 (default filter length)
air_F=1 (air attenuation)
dist_F=1 (distance attenuation)
Fc_HP=20 (high-pass filter above 20Hz)
smooth_F=1 (fractional delay filters)
alpha_F=1 (surface opacity = reflectivity)
